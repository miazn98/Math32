# Math32


## This repo contains the code used in Andrew Sosanya and I's Math 32 project:
Computing Euler characteristics of a 2d binary array using neural networks. The main python notebook file contains all code necessary to generate the datasets of 12x12 binary arrays as well as training and implementing the neural decision tree. The other pyhton files contain code to implement the singular MLP method in pytorch.
